# Trader Joe's Inventory Simulation Project

This repository contains Python code for simulating and analyzing inventory management at Trader Joe's. The project is divided into four parts, each focusing on a specific aspect of data analysis and simulation.

---

## Part 1: Data Exploration
**Goal**: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on collected customer entry and item removal data.  
**Key Outputs**: 
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, variance).
- Histograms for customer entries and item removals.
- Summary of trends for on-peak and off-peak periods.

---

## Part 2: Statistical Distribution Fitting
**Goal**: Fit statistical distributions to customer entry and item removal data.  
**Key Outputs**: 
- Best-fit distributions with parameter estimates.
- Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test results.
- Q-Q plots to visualize the goodness-of-fit.

## Part 3: Customer Arrival and Item Depletion Simulation
**Goal**: Simulate customer arrivals and item depletion for on-peak and off-peak periods based on fitted distributions.  
**Key Outputs**: 
- Simulated time-series data for customer entries and item removals.
- Comparison of simulated vs. actual data using statistical metrics.

---

## Part 4: Inventory Model Simulation
**Goal**: Evaluate (s, S) inventory models using Monte Carlo simulations to optimize inventory levels and restocking strategies.  
**Key Outputs**: 
- Simulation results for different (s, S) scenarios.
- Metrics such as average stockouts, overstock levels, and restocking frequency.
- Visualization of inventory trends over multiple runs.
